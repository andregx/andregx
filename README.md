# Andre Borges
**Director of Technology | Systems Architect**

I am a technical leader with a background in Physics and Architecture, which fundamentally shapes my approach to software. I view systems as physical entities where topology, pressure (load), and structural integrity (uptime) are the primary constraints.

Over the last 15 years, I have progressed from building foundational project management tools to founding an AI-driven startup where I developed a 4-patent portfolio. Following the acquisition of my company, I was retained as Director of Technology to oversee large-scale system modernization and post-merger technical integration.

### Engineering Philosophy & Impact

* **High-Concurrency Topology:** I design systems for predictable scale. I conceived and executed the architecture that handled ~1B predictions with sub-600ms latency and a 99.99% real-time SLA.
* **The 40/40/20 Management Model:** I divide my leadership between Mentorship (professionalizing squads and engineering culture), Strategy (modular long-term ROI and architectural roadmaps), and Hands-on Innovation (prototyping complex ETL operators and algorithmic logic).
* **FinOps as Engineering:** I treat infrastructure costs as a primary engineering metric. I am currently executing a roadmap to reduce legacy system costs by 70-80% while increasing delivery speed by 85%.
