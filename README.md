# Hey, visitor!

My name is Andre, I am a remote software developer and team lead specialized in deploying real-time applications using **AWS**, **MongoDB** as a database and **Python** 3.10 along with Django as a software stack.


# History

Previously, I co-founded and managed a data-driven fashion platform that used computer vision and AI to provide personalized recommendations to users. I was responsible for creating and leading teams, data schemas, managing and maintaining large databases, and ensuring high performance and availability of the system. I also led a team of data scientists and engineers, and partnered with fashion brands and retailers. My work enabled the company to grow its user base, revenue, and partnerships.

## Important KPIs

* Maintained a fully deployed real-time system on AWS delivering more than 10MM recommendations per month;
* Mean target for the system latency : 0.5s;
* Automatic integration and data ingestion into vectorized data units using a very cheap MongoDB server, employing cache strategies to reduce the server workload and keep costs down;
* Low maintenance system: SLA of 99.8% of uptime with no system maintenance (only maintenance required when major version was deprecated by Amazon).

> **Important business achievement**: reducing cloud services cost by more than 40% using smart coding strategies, simplifying microsservices and enabling structural caching where suitable so as to reduce or downscale hardware where appropriate.

## Currently Working on

* Improving coding skills using Python as a structural language and Django as a framework;
* Developing dashboards using lean coding based on React as a framework with as little libraries as possible.
* Using classic CSS instead of support libraries for better and leaner user experience results.
