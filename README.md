# Andre Borges
**Director of Technology | Systems Architect**

## Hi, I'm Andre

I architect systems the way physicists study matter — through topology, pressure, and structural integrity.
With a background in Physics and Architecture, I approach software as a physical discipline. Load is pressure. Uptime is structural integrity. Scale is topology. This lens shapes every technical decision I make.
Over 15 years, I've gone from building foundational project management tools to founding an AI-driven startup, developing a 4-patent portfolio, and following acquisition leading large-scale system modernization as Director of Technology.

## What I work on

* Systems Architecture: High-concurrency topologies built for predictable scale — ~1B predictions, sub-600ms latency, 99.99% real-time SLA
* AI & Predictive Logic: 4 INPI patents in Predictive Logic and Computer Vision
* FinOps Engineering: Treating infrastructure cost as a primary engineering metric — currently executing a 70–80% cost reduction roadmap
* ETL & Data Infrastructure: Automated pipelines, NoSQL at scale, data normalization
Engineering Leadership: The 40/40/20 model — Mentorship · Strategy · Hands-on Innovation


## Engineering Philosophy & Impact

* High-Concurrency Topology: I design systems for predictable scale. I conceived and executed the architecture that handled ~1B predictions with sub-600ms latency and a 99.99% real-time SLA.
* The 40/40/20 Management Model: I divide my leadership between Mentorship (professionalizing squads and engineering culture), Strategy (modular long-term ROI and architectural roadmaps), and Hands-on Innovation (prototyping complex ETL operators and algorithmic logic).
* FinOps as Engineering: I treat infrastructure costs as a primary engineering metric. I am currently executing a roadmap to reduce legacy system costs by 70-80% while increasing delivery speed by 85%.


## Technical Signature

* Core: Python, TypeScript, NestJS, AWS (S3, EC2, Lambda)
* Data Infrastructure: NoSQL (MongoDB), Automated ETL, Data Normalization at scale
* Reliability: K6 (Performance Testing), Datadog (Observability), SRE/DevOps
* Innovation: 4 INPI patents in Predictive Logic and Computer Vision
* AI: agentic drones, CI/CD revisors
